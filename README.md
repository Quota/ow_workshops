# Overwatch Workshops

This is my collection of overwatch workshops (the source code) that I either like to use or even added to it.

# Practice Range Plus Plus

File: [practice_range_pp.txt](src/main/ow/practice_range_pp.txt) \
Code: `6BH1A` (Version 3.4 by me), `9YTTH` (Version 3.3 by Scales), `AJERA` (Version 2.2 by PMSJellies)

An improved version of the practice range. Originally by PMSJellies (known as Practice Range 2.2), with additions by
Scales (known as Practice Range 3.3).

Additions in my version `6BH1A`:
* Reinhardt
  * Add ability to charge
  * Add function to switch between random actions and specific actions
  * In random mode all actions are now equally likley to happen (before: P(ultimate)=3/5, P(others)=1/5)
* McCree
  * Fix button allowing to remove him again
