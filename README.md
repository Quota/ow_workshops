# Overwatch Workshops

This is my collection of overwatch workshops (the source code) that I either like to use or even added to it.

# Practice Range Plus Plus

File: [practice_range_pp.txt](src/main/ow/practice_range_pp.txt) \
Code: `6BH1A` (Version 3.4-3.5 by me), `9YTTH` (Version 3.3 by Scales), `AJERA` (Version 2.2 by PMSJellies)

An improved version of the practice range. Originally by PMSJellies (known as Practice Range 2.2), with additions by
Scales (known as Practice Range 3.3).

Additions in my version `6BH1A` 3.4:
* Reinhardt

  * Add function to switch between random actions and specific actions
  * In random mode all actions are now equally likley to happen (before: P(ultimate)=3/5, P(others)=1/5)
* McCree
  * Fix button allowing to remove him again

Additions in my version `6BH1A` 3.5:
* Cassidy
  * Adopt his new name
* Reinhard
  * Switching through modes now shows a short text describing the current mode
* Reaper
  * Fix an issue where his shadow step got async with his location (e.g. after getting slept)
* Mei
  * Let her stand half a second longer without ice block
* Widow
  * Let her stand half a second longer after landing
* General
  * Remove ability cooldowns
